# Credit Card Fraudulent Transaction Detection Model

This Streamlit web application is built to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The model leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction patterns and identify potentially fraudulent activities.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs to explore transaction data.
- **Fraud Detection**: Utilizes machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Allows users to input transaction details and receive instant predictions on the likelihood of fraud.
- **Model Performance**: Displays metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
